#Shaked's Github Anomaly Detector

Hey reviewer! <br>
To simply run this application you need java 11 (or above) and maven installed. <br>
***I recommend to open the project with IntelliJ and run the code with JDK11.*** <br>
<br><br>
To check the code you would have to:
1. create a free github organization.
2. expose your local network to the internet (I used ngrok) with http protocol on port 8080.
3. create a github webhook for events: [PUSH, REPOSITORY, TEAM] which call 'http://<your-ngrok-route>/hook'
4. run the application and enjoy the result.

<br>
